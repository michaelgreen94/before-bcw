                <li>
                    <strong>Void Swarm</strong>: Malzahar summons Voidlings to attack nearby enemies. Passive: Casting Malzahar's
                    other spells gives him Gathering Swarm, increasing the number of Voidlings summoned by Void Swarm (max

                <li>
                    <strong>Nether Grasp</strong>: Malzahar channels the essence of the Void to suppress an enemy champion over a
                    zone of damaging negative energy. Malzahar suppresses a target champion for 2.5 seconds, dealing 125/200/275
                    (+80% Ability Power) magic damage over the duration. A zone of negative energy is created around his
                    target for 5 seconds, dealing 2/3/4% (+[1% Ability Power]%) of nearby enemies max health as magic damage

        <blockquote>
            <p> A zealous seer dedicated to the unification of all life, Malzahar truly believes the newly emergent Void to be
                the path to Runeterra’s salvation. In the desert wastes of Shurima, he followed the voices that whispered
                in his mind, all the way to ancient Icathia. Amidst the ruins of that land, he gazed into the dark heart
                of the Void itself, and was gifted new power and purpose. Malzahar now sees himself as a shepherd, empowered
                to bring others into the fold… or to release the voidling creatures that dwell beneath.</p>
            "Come mortal, witness your demise!"</blockquote>
